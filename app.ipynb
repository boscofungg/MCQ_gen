       "Document(page_content='Chapter 1\\nCost and Beneﬁt Analysis\\nEconomics is about the study of decisions. Decisions are everywhere in our daily life. Assume that\\ndecision-makers have a single well-deﬁned objective, the guiding principle to decisions for the maximi-\\nzation of such objective is the cost and beneﬁt principle.\\nIn this chapter, we will start with an illustration of the simple cost and beneﬁt principle, and\\nthen many extension and applications of the principle under diﬀerent scenarios. Variants of these\\napplications will be seen repeatedly in later chapters.\\n1.1 Should we enlarge the class size?\\nConsider the choice of class size of an introductory microeconomics course. Suppose we are considering\\ntwo diﬀerent class sizes: a big section of 300 students or 12 sections of 25 students. If we do not consider\\nthe cost at all, most of us will prefer the class size of 25 because other things equal, a smaller class will\\nallow better interaction among the students and professors, and therefore better learning outcomes.\\nOf course, the costs of the two diﬀerent class sizes are not the same. It is generally more costly to have\\nsmaller classes!\\nFor the sake of illustration, let’s ignore the cost of equipment and venue (i.e., assume that it is\\nzero) and focus on the cost of hiring instructors. Suppose the cost of hiring an instructor to teach a\\nsection is $90,000. Hiring one instructor to teach a section of 300 implies an average cost of $300 per\\nstudent. Hiring instructors to teach 12 sections of 25 students implies an average cost of $3,600 per\\nstudent. University administrators and students must consider this trade-oﬀ of choosing class sizes:\\nFor better learning outcome, we have to pay a higher cost per student.\\nWe have to consider the trade-oﬀs in making this decision because resources are scarce and we have\\nunlimited wants , i.e. that available resource is not enough to fulﬁll all of our wants. In this example,\\nthe resources will be the budget of the university, and our budget for studying. If we want to have\\nsmaller classes, we must contribute more resources. If we want to save resources, we must have larger\\nclasses. In short, there is simply no free lunch.\\n1', metadata={'source': '/Users/boscofung/Desktop/AI project/MCQcreator/Sample Data/CH1.pdf', 'page': 0})"
